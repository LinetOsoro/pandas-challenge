The goal is to create and manipulate PandaS DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data. 
 
Create a District Summary that shows the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame. 

Then create a School Summary with a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school. Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

Create a DataFrame called spending_summary
 
Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
 
Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary. This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".

Write a report that presents a cohesive written analysis tha summarizes the analysis and draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations
